# ProduceRecognition
Produce recognition using Artificial Intelligence with Keras and Tensorflow as backend

## How to run the project?
### Requirements: 

In order to run the code you need the two libraries that we used installed on your machine.
- Keras version 2.x : any subversion of Keras 2 will work, the code of prediction is compatible with Keras version 1, however the retraining part will not work because it needs dependencies from version 2 of keras
- Tensorflow : we are using Tensorflow as a backend without calling it directly so any up to date version of Tensorflow will work

### Download our trained Model (~ 100 MB) : 
Trained model is available on this google Drive  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DDI2MXrvIz_KEOxaNozUHuvadfS1ovf2/view

### Runing
You have to have your target image stored in the same directory under the name "target.jpg" or "target.jpeg" 
Dowloaded weights resnet50_5classes.h5 has to be also in the same directory.
